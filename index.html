                <p>Oi oi! Welcome to our page, squires! Let's kick off with the basics, WTF are we about?...It's simple really - unique pieces of artwork, wacky, hilarious and ridiculous in equal parts, unlocking a BUNCH of rewards for holders. With all of our collectibles being individually conceptualised and illustrated.</p>
                <p>We're rolling out an initial 100 selling at auction - these will be valued as rare as they are the earliest editions. Additionally, the (very lucky) first time buyers of these first 100 will have a lifetime of all rewards, which means even if they sell on the collectibles (why would you?!) they will still benefit from the perks. Have a gander at the roadmap to check out the timeline for the future drops.</p>
                <p>Our collection (10,000+) will expand to include some surprises as these hybrids are released into the world. Trust us, you won't find any collectibles as unique and personality packed as ours. Start collecting your favourite characters, enjoy some WTF moments and join what is going to be the most fun community in the world of NFTs.</p>

            <p>Well, we've literally just launched. So start asking away, and if there are any frequently asked (which we're sure there will be) we'll add 'em in. Initial questions, however, require an offering to be answered. This is in the form of taping a piece of fruit to a wall for 11 seconds and taking a video...you can DM it to us. Chat soon, you lovely bunch.</p>
